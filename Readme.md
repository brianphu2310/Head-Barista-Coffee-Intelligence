## The Problem I Was Actually Trying to Solve

I used to work as a barista — pulling shots, steaming milk, dialling in grinders. It was repetitive in the best possible way. Every morning the same ritual, but every cup slightly different depending on humidity, grind size, tamp pressure, bean origin.

What drove me insane was customer questions I couldn't answer well.

*"What's the difference between a Chemex and a V60?"*
*"If I like strong coffee, which beans should I get?"*
*"Is Ethiopian better than Colombian for espresso?"*

I knew the *vibe* of the answers from experience. But I didn't have **data** behind them. I was giving recommendations the same way every barista does — based on personal preference dressed up as expertise.

That bothered me more and more. The coffee world is full of strong opinions and very little analysis.

> *If you scraped every brewing method, mapped the flavour profiles, cross-referenced bean origins, and built a model on top — could you give a customer a genuinely data-driven recommendation in 30 seconds?*

I left the counter, opened a laptop, and built this.

##  What This Project Solves

### Problem 1: Customers don't know which brewing method suits them

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Just try an espresso" — generic advice based on nothing | App asks **4 questions** and recommends the best brewing method for you |
| No data on how methods differ by strength, acidity, body | **Structured comparison** across 8+ brewing methods |
| Barista recommendations are subjective and inconsistent | **Consistent, data-backed** consultant available 24/7 |

**Solution:** Streamlit app (Coffee Beans Consultant) — takes your flavour preferences and recommends the optimal method.

---

### Problem 2: No structured dataset exists for brewing method comparison

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Brewing method info is scattered across blogs, forums, manufacturer sites | **Single structured dataset** scraped and cleaned from multiple sources |
| No standardised metrics for comparing methods | Consistent attributes: brew time, water temp, grind size, strength, acidity, body |
| Hobbyists rely on YouTube and Reddit for guidance | **Excel dashboard** with pivot tables for side-by-side comparison |

**Solution:** `BREWING_METHODS_SCRAPING.ipynb` — multi-source scraping pipeline → `Coffee_Brewing_Methods_Raw.xlsx` → `Coffee_Brewing_Dashboard_Final.xlsx`.

---

### Problem 3: Business owners don't know what to stock or promote

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Café owners guess which beans and methods are trending | **Tableau dashboard** shows popularity patterns and flavour distribution |
| No visual way to compare brewing methods at scale | **Interactive filters** by brew style, strength, acidity, origin |
| "What should I put on the menu?" answered by gut feel | **Data-driven menu decisions** backed by structured analysis |

**Solution:** Tableau dashboard with filters for brew method, roast level, bean origin, and flavour profile.

---

### Problem 4: The "perfect cup" question has no consistent answer

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Best brewing method" varies by who you ask | **Flavour matrix** maps each method across 5 taste dimensions |
| No data on how bean origin interacts with brewing method | **Cross-analysis** of origin × method shows which combinations score highest |
| Beginners overwhelmed by options | **Tiered recommendations:** beginner / intermediate / enthusiast |

**Solution:** Colab analysis — correlation between brewing parameters and flavour outcome, visualised with Plotly.

### Standardisation & cleaning

```python

##  Database — Supabase SQL

**Folder:** `SupabasSQL/`

The cleaned dataset is stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL instance. The Streamlit app queries Supabase directly — meaning the recommendation engine always reads the latest data without redeploying.

```sql
-- Core table: brewing methods
CREATE TABLE brewing_methods (
    id                SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    method_name       TEXT NOT NULL,

                POWER(body_score     - p_body,     2)

```

**Why Supabase instead of local PostgreSQL?**

Supabase is a hosted Postgres-as-a-service with a REST API and real-time subscriptions. The Streamlit app deployed on Streamlit Cloud can't maintain a connection to a local database — Supabase solves this with zero infrastructure management. Any update to the dataset in Supabase instantly reflects in the live app.

##  Key Findings

### Finding 1 — Espresso is the outlier in every dimension

| Method | Strength | Acidity | Body | Brew Time |
|--------|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| Espresso | **9.5** | 6.0 | **9.0** | **0.5 min** |
| V60 | 5.5 | **8.5** | 3.5 | 3.5 min |
| French Press | 7.0 | 3.5 | **8.5** | 4.0 min |
| Cold Brew | 8.0 | 2.5 | 7.0 | 720 min |
| AeroPress | 7.5 | 5.5 | 6.0 | 2.0 min |
| Chemex | 5.0 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 5.0 min |

Espresso is the only method that simultaneously maximises strength *and* body in under one minute. Every other high-strength method trades off body or requires much longer brew times.

---

### Finding 2 — Acidity and body are inversely correlated across methods

| Correlation | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Acidity ↔ Body | **−0.71** | Strong inverse — bright coffees are thin; heavy coffees are flat |
| Strength ↔ Brew time | −0.43 | Medium inverse — faster methods are often stronger |
| Water temp ↔ Acidity | +0.38 | Slight positive — hotter water extracts more acids |

> This explains why French Press lovers rarely enjoy V60 and vice versa. It's not personal taste — it's physics. They occupy opposite ends of the acidity-body spectrum by design.

---

### Finding 3 — Ethiopian beans are the most versatile origin

| Origin | Compatible Methods | Peak Method | Avg Flavour Score |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Ethiopia** | **7** | V60, Chemex, Aeropress | 8.2 |
| Colombia | 6 | Drip, Pour Over, French Press | 7.6 |
| Brazil | 5 | Espresso, French Press, Moka Pot | 7.1 |
| Kenya | 4 | V60, Aeropress, Cold Brew | 8.0 |
| Guatemala | 4 | Drip, Chemex, French Press | 7.3 |

Ethiopian beans appeared in the top-performing combinations for 7 of 8 brewing methods — the only origin that works well across both high-acidity filter methods and lower-acidity immersion methods.

---

### Finding 4 — AeroPress is the beginner's shortcut to complex flavour

| Method | Difficulty | Flavour Complexity | Forgiving? |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Espresso | Advanced | Very High | ❌ No |
| V60 | Intermediate | High | ❌ No |
| **AeroPress** | **Beginner** | **High** | **✅ Yes** |
| French Press | Beginner | Medium | ✅ Yes |
| Cold Brew | Beginner | Medium | ✅ Yes |
| Chemex | Intermediate | High | ❌ No |

AeroPress is the only method that combines beginner accessibility, forgiving technique tolerance, and genuinely complex flavour output. The data confirms what specialty coffee shops intuitively know — it's the gateway drug to serious brewing.

### Why Supabase over local PostgreSQL?

Streamlit Cloud deployments can't connect to `localhost`. Supabase provides a hosted PostgreSQL instance with a stable connection string that works from anywhere — including Streamlit Cloud, Google Colab, and local development simultaneously. The `recommend_brewing_method()` function runs server-side, keeping recommendation logic decoupled from the app layer.

### Why score brewing parameters 1–10 instead of keeping raw values?

Raw values (brew time in minutes, temperature in °C, grind size as text) are incomparable. A Euclidean distance-based recommendation on raw values would weight temperature (range: 85–100°C) as 15× more important than brew time (range: 0.5–8 min) — which is meaningless. Normalising to 1–10 makes every dimension equally weighted in the similarity calculation.

##  Limitations & What I'd Do With More Data

The dataset covers ~80 brewing methods and configurations. That's enough to build a working recommender, but not enough to capture the full complexity of speciality coffee.

With more data I would:

- **Add user feedback loop** — the Streamlit app currently recommends but doesn't learn. Adding a "was this helpful?" button and storing responses in Supabase would let the recommendation function improve over time through a simple feedback weighting system
- **Include bean varietal data** — the current dataset treats origin as a proxy for flavour (Ethiopia ≈ fruity). In reality, a Yirgacheffe and a Sidama are both Ethiopian but taste completely different. Varietal-level data would make recommendations dramatically more precise
- **Model seasonal extraction variance** — humidity and ambient temperature affect extraction; a barista's ideal parameters in Sydney summer differ from Sydney winter. Adding a `season` parameter to the recommendation function would make it genuinely location-aware
- **Scrape customer reviews** — Yelp and Google Maps reviews for cafés often mention brewing methods and flavour notes. NLP sentiment analysis on those reviews would validate whether the structured flavour scores in this dataset actually match how real customers experience the coffee
